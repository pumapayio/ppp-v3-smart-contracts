# Registry Contract

## Introduction
This Registry contract is a central contract which keeps the record of all the contracts in the ecosystem.   
It stores the contract name associated with the contract addresses.   
Anyone can get the addresses of any contract.  
The Registry also stores the configurations for the ecosystem ex. Execution fee, supported tokens, extension period etc.

## Contract version
pragma solidity 0.8.0

## Contract constructor - Initializer
In this contract the `initialize()` method is used in place of the constructor to allow the contract to be upgradable via proxy.

#### Method detail:
The initialize method is used to initialize the Registry contract and transfers the ownership of the registry to the admin who deploys the registry.

#### Method signature:
`function initialize(uint256 _executionFee) external;`

#### Method parameters:
1. **\_executionFee:**:
   Indicates the execution fee percentage. here 1% is equal to 100.

## Contract Methods

### isOneOf()
#### Method detail:
This method tells you whether the given address is registered in the registry or not.  
We need to provide the list of contract identifier hashes and the sender address whose membership to be verified.

Indicates the list of contract identifier hashes.
2. **sender:**  
Indicates the contract address.

#### Returned data:
This method returns true if the given address is one of the registered contract otherwise it returns false.

### addToken()
